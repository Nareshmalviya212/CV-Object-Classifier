# CV-Object-Classifier
## Normal Car and Damage Car
* I create the model using CNN and CV. The model classify normal and damage car on the basis of image
* First I took dataset from Kaggle.com 
* Then separate the training data and validation data 
* Created a neural network in which 3 hidden layers were created and different filters and neurons were given in each.
* Relu is used in the activation function. And used sigmoid in last hidden layer because we have to do binary classification. 
* Then trained the model with steps per epoch=10 or epochs=15 and got 80% accuracy.
## Note- Accuracy was low because the data was very less
# Testing Result

## Mask and without Mask
* I re-used the same steps that I used in Car classifier and changed the steps per epochs=20 and epochs=10
* Trained the model and I got 91 accuracy. because i had more data
