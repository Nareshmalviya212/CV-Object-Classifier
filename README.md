# CV-Object-Classifier
I create the model using CNN and CV. The model classify normal and damage car on the basis of image
First I took dataset from Kaggle.com 
Then separate the training data and validation data 
Created a neural network in which 3 hidden layers were created and different filters and neurons were given in each.
Relu is used in the activation function. And used sigmoid in last hidden layer because we have to do binary classification. 
Then trained the model with steps per epoch=10 or epochs=15 and got 80% accuracy.
# Accuracy was low because the data was very less
